    'aosp' is the official Android remote where we get the sources from.
    We've removed the 'review' tag, because we don't want to upload our changes for review
    to the official Android Gerrit server. Maybe we'll set up our own later, but that hasn't
    happened yet.
    We're forking some Android projects, but not all of them. Our forked projects are conveniently
    marked as such, and use the remote 'cibernoid-official', our official version control system
    hosted at GitHub. All the other projects are fetched from AOSP official servers, tagged under
    'android-6.1.0_r10'.
